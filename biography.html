        <p>
          I was born and raised in the wine country of Sonoma County,
          California, and joined the U. S. Navy from San Francisco in May of
          1999. I am a graduate student at Georgetown University with one
          capstone project remaining before taking my Master’s Degree in
          Emergency and Disaster Management
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I currently serve as the Radiological Emergency Preparedness Director
          of Regulatory Affairs and Oversight for the US Navy Nuclear Propulsion
          Program in the State of California. I am responsible for regulatory
          oversight of all regional emergency preparedness efforts for the Naval
          Nuclear Propulsion Program in the State of California, including
          training, exercises, and outreach with federal, state, and local
          authorities. I am responsible for oversight of all San Diego emergency
          control center personnel, including command staff, public information
          officers, and engineering, reactor plant and radiological technical
          branches.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I work as a nuclear propulsion plant operations technical expert for
          the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and U.S. Navy, specializing in
          pressurized water nuclear reactor operations onboard U.S. aircraft
          carriers and submarines. Although now in a civilian role at the DOE, I
          am still an active duty Naval Officer, and hav served several tours of
          duty on multiple aircraft carriers. I taught nuclear operations to
          DOD, DOE, and Lockheed Martin students at the Knolls Atomic Power
          Laboratory’s Kesselring Site in New York from 2004-2007 and have
          deployed overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom on four
          occasions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have traveled extensively with the U.S. Navy, visiting such
          countries as Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, China, United Arab
          Emirates, and Bahrain.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My current duties require oversight of thousands of engineers,
          managers, inspectors, and production workers at a 1,000+ employee
          fleet activity site and 15,000+ employee Naval shipyard to ensure
          regulatory compliance of all joint DOE/DOD Naval Nuclear Propulsion
          Program requirements.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Resources Management from
          The New School University’s Milano School of International Affairs,
          Management, and Urban Policy, New York, NY. Additionally, I have
          studied radiological emergency planning at Harvard University’s T.H.
          Chan School of Public Health and business administration with emphasis
          in sustainability at Seattle University’s Albers School of Business
          and Economics.
